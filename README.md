## Hola ðŸ‘‹

I'm a final year undergrad pursing Computer Science and Engineering at Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology (MAIT).

I'm a coding enthusiast and a frontend web developer. 

I'm the co-founder of [Girl Code It](https://www.linkedin.com/company/girl-code-it/). Girl Code It aka GCI is a group of people who firmly believe that "Knowledge grows when shared" and is eager to build a healthy coding culture among young coders. Being an avid coder, I want to contribute my best to the society! ðŸ˜„
